							<h3>What the Customer Wanted </h3>
							<ol>
								<li>To run functionality tests on refurbished smartphones using our MATT robot.</li>
								<li>Fit multiple fixtures on the same platform and run functionality tests in parallel.</li>
								<li>Functionality tests should consider the cameras, speakers, screen, side buttons and haptics.</li>
							</ol>

							<div class="grid-container">
								<div class="grid-left">
									<h3> What We Delivered</h3>
									<p>Our smart fixtures were designed to be operated single-handedly and quickly, reducing setup time to less than 7 seconds per device.</p>
									<p>The fixtures were robust enough to withstand multiple weeks of testing yet modular enough to allow for a quick swapping of worn parts.</p>
									<p>We aimed to primarily accomodate the iPhone lineup but extended to some newer Samsung devices too.</p>

									<h3> What worked and what didn't </h3>
									<p>Thanks to the power of FDM 3D printing, I was able to iterate through dozens of designs before converging to a dependable one.</p>
									<p>The most challenging sub-module was responsible for actuating the mute switch on iPhones. It needed to be confined in a tight space and be dependable enough not to cause false positives during tesing. Compliant mechanisms were explored in depth but they proved to be inadequate in an industrial environment.</p>

									<h3> What was documentated </h3>
									<p>To confront the inevitability of miscommunication, I also prepared documentation on how to assemble the mechanical components and electrical wiring.</p>
									<p>All part markings corresponded to their ID in the bill of materials. This helped reference their version information as well as material composition and variant number.</p>

							<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Simulate the viscoelastic reaction force of an insulin cartridge while the insulin pump is running.</li>
								<li>Actuation in a range of 5 cm with a resolution of 10 microns and a maximum force of 30 Newtons.</li>
								<li>Run continuously for a few days on-end without losing pressure.</li>
							</ul>
						
							<div class="grid-container">
								<div class="grid-left grid-text">
									<h3>Structural Elements</h3>
									<p>We used two linear piezoelectric motors in parallel to push on a rod that plunged into the insulin pump in place of the cartridge. Force feedback was established by placing a load cell in-between the rod and the motor shafts. </p>
									<p>The structure is comprised of aluminum rails fitted with 3D-printed PCB rafts and safety panels. An aluminum plate constrains the two motors and the linear bearing to ensure proper alignment with the rod.</p>

									<h3>Control Strategy</h3>
									<p> Piezoelectric motors are tough to control when they are coupled together because of the tight tolerances required. Nanometer-scale resolution implies a sensitivity to nanometer-level misalignment! Therefore, we used compliance in our design to avoid over-constraining the assembly. </p>
									<p>Furthermore, the load cell was preloaded by a spring mechanism to avoid backlash in the force feedback signal.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Designing a Cheaper MATT Robot</h2>

							<h3>How it started</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>The current MATT robots were made from bent sheet metal which was expensive and relied on experienced manual labor.</li>
								<li>I proposed to base the design around flat metal sheets and extruded aluminum posts instead.</li>
								<li>The same aesthetics and geometry needed to be preserved while the reduction in cost of production needed to be great enough to be considered in our low volume production setting.</li>
							</ul>
						
							<div class="grid-container">
								<div class="grid-left grid-text">
									<h3>Designing a custom AL Extrusion</h3>
									<p>The name of the game is to simplify the geometry such as to have the minimal number of cores, a small number of tight-tolerance faces, and preferrably no sharp angles.</p>
									<p>Extensive work was done to prepare the design for manufacturing, and this involved collaborating with aluminum manufacturers in Europe to find a low-volume solution adaptable to our prototyping needs.</p>

									<h3>Results</h3>
									<p> We managed to halve the bill of materials both in terms of part number and overall cost, having more potential savings with increased volume.</p>
