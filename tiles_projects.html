							<h3>What the Customer Wanted </h3>
							<ol>
								<li>To run functionality tests on refurbished smartphones using our MATT robot.</li>
								<li>Fit multiple fixtures on the same platform and run functionality tests in parallel.</li>
								<li>Functionality tests should consider the cameras, speakers, screen, side buttons and haptics.</li>

									<h3> What We Delivered</h3>
									<p>Our smart fixtures were designed to be operated single-handedly and quickly, reducing setup time to less than 7 seconds per device.</p>
									<p>The fixtures were robust enough to withstand multiple weeks of testing yet modular enough to allow for a quick swapping of worn parts.</p>
									<p>We aimed to primarily accomodate the iPhone lineup but extended to some newer Samsung devices too.</p>

									<p>Thanks to the power of FDM 3D printing, I was able to iterate through dozens of designs before converging to a dependable one.</p>
									<p>The most challenging sub-module was responsible for actuating the mute switch on iPhones. It needed to be confined in a tight space and be dependable enough not to cause false positives during tesing. Compliant mechanisms were explored in depth but they proved to be inadequate in an industrial environment.</p>

								<li>Simulate the viscoelastic reaction force of an insulin cartridge while the insulin pump is running.</li>
								<li>Actuation in a range of 5 cm with a resolution of 10 microns and a maximum force of 30 Newtons.</li>

									<h3>Structural Elements</h3>
									<p>We used two linear piezoelectric motors in parallel to push on a rod that plunged into the insulin pump in place of the cartridge. Force feedback was established by placing a load cell in-between the rod and the motor shafts. </p>
									<p>The structure is comprised of aluminum rails fitted with 3D-printed PCB rafts and safety panels. An aluminum plate constrains the two motors and the linear bearing to ensure proper alignment with the rod.</p>

								<li>The current MATT robots were made from bent sheet metal which was expensive and relied on experienced manual labor.</li>
								<li>I proposed to base the design around flat metal sheets and extruded aluminum posts instead.</li>

									<h3>Designing a custom AL Extrusion</h3>
									<p>The name of the game is to simplify the geometry such as to have the minimal number of cores, a small number of tight-tolerance faces, and preferrably no sharp angles.</p>

									<p>The round linear rails were self-built out of low-cost COTS. The two rails would not need to be adjusted, but instead all the precision would follow from the machined aluminium end blocks.</p>
									<p>Motor speed reduction would be achieved through a chain-sprocket geartrain at one end.</p>
									<p>A rotary encoder would measure motor velocity, and another would measure the pendulum tilt angle.</p>

									<h3>Component Analysis - Belt Tensioner</h3>
									<p>The first iteration for a timing belt tensioner used a separate strip to provide tooth engagement between the two loose ends. A bolt from the top would clamp into a metal plate and onto the top of the connecting piece. This strategy sucked becasue four bolts needed to be tightened at once for maximum force to be applies, plus the tensioning screw tore through the belt multiple times.</p>
									<p>A second approach used two clamps mahcined out of aluminium, which would be pulled into each other via two socket head bolts. This approach applied much more tension and took less time to configure, however there was still the issue of securing the belt to either side of the clamp.</p>
