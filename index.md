Dear reader,

Welcome to some personal trivia in relation to my engineering interests.

I hope by the time you leave this page you will be filled with an immense sense of purpose and satisfaction.
If, on the other hand, you depart with an aching sense of existential dread, I am sincerely sorry; I will do my best to write in English next time.

This blog has certain rules I will strive to follow.
1. No smoking.
2. No politics.
3. No humour fluids, only fluid humor.
4. No misinformation unless strictly necessary to mask my identity as Batman.

Feel free to reach out to me for any questions or clarifications. And if you send me spam it better be Jalapeno flavored.
Happy browsing!

- Andrei
