Welcome to some personal trivia in relation to my engineering interests.
I hope by the time you leave this page you will be filled with an immense sense of purpose and satisfaction.
If on the other hand you depart with an increased sense of existential dread, I am sinceely sorry, I will do my best to write in English next time.

This blog has certain rules I will strive to follow.
1. No smoking.
2. No politics.
3. No humour fluids, only fluid humor.
4. No misinformation unless strictly necessary to mask my identity as Batman.

Thank you and happy browsing.
